# BaerNet

Jake: You should try to use Git from the Terminal to download the entire project before resorting to the zip file method below. This way, you'll be able to run a quick Git command in Terminal to merge all my latest changes/additions to your copy of the project and even merge those changes with any you've on your version. To do so, try to run these commands:

```sh
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/projectew/BaerNet
```

This will download the project into a folder named *BaerNet* in your *Documents* folder. The files you're interested in are all under the *src* directory. The HTML is under *src/html* and the CSS is under *src/css*.

If you receive an error message, you can just visit <https://github.com/projectew/BaerNet>, click the green **Code** dropdown button, then the **Download ZIP** button at the bottom of the list. Extract that to your *Downloads* folder and it will contain the *src* diretory just like before.
